# Product Vision

- We want to create an IoT device to allow a user to have automatic shopping list creation when they throw items away that are recurring purchases.

- The device would be a barcode scanner interfaced with a raspberry pi that will allow the user to easily scan an item before disposal. The scanned barcode will be read with an API and code will be created to send the barcode from the device to a database. 

- The database will connect with a website for the user to access their shopping cart. A public database holding barcode information will be used to display the item on the web page by itâ€™s human-readable name.
